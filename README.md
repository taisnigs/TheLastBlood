# Welcome to The Last Blood.
 
The Last Blood is an open-source multiplayer shooter written in C++ using Unreal Engine 4.

Previously, the game was in development in 2018-2019, but was stopped by coincidence.

Our main goal is to make a game with all features that was intended to be in a original game.
